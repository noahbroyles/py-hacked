# py-hacked
## A short python program to make it look like you've been hacked

Leave this running sometime on your computer in a full screen terminal/command prompt in a public place. Just wait for the questions and comments! 

The only external module this program requires is `termcolor`. It will still work without it, it just won't look as cool.

### To run:
#### Mac or Linux (way to go!):
To install `termcolor`, run: `python3 -m pip install termcolor`. Then to run the program, execute `python3 main.py`

#### Windows (less preferable):
To install `termcolor`, run: `python -m pip install termcolor`. Then to run the program, execute `python main.py`
